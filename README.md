It is a simple game for python3 on pygame, so install pygame otherwise the game won't work. 
You can move the blue cube (the player) with the arrowns (only from left to right). 
The red cubes are your enemy's, if a red cube tuches the blue cube it is game over and the game quites. 
after the game quit you can see your level(s) seconds and the points. 
Each time you hit (by shuting a projectile) a red cube you will get 1 point. 
You can shoot 1 projectile per sec. 
To start the game, you just have to type or whatever you do this, python3 my_legendary_game.py
